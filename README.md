# 📚 Library Management System API

A backend API built using **ASP.NET Core Web API** to manage student-library records. This project demonstrates integration with **SQL Server** using **Entity Framework Core** and **stored procedures**, and showcases real-world API design, testing, and deployment workflows.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Library Management System API was developed as a personal learning project to strengthen backend development skills in the .NET ecosystem. It supports CRUD operations on student-library data and integrates with external tools to simulate real-world enterprise usage.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Language**: C#
- **Database**: SQL Server
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core
- **API Testing**: Swagger, Postman
- **Deployment**: Azure App Service
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Terminal Usage**: Bash/Shell commands for Git operations
- **Frontend Integration**: JavaScript with ASP.NET Web Forms via Cora Sequence tool

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- RESTful API design following MVC architecture (Model–Controller)
- Executes **stored procedures** for optimized SQL operations
- API endpoints return JSON data for frontend consumption
- Asynchronous programming (`async/await`) for improved performance
- Integrated with **Cora Sequence** via **Consumer API** for form-level field automation
- Deployed to **Azure App Service** for live access and testing
- Manual Git push/pull operations using **terminal commands** in Visual Studio

---

## 🧪 API Testing

- **Swagger UI**: Enabled for in-browser API exploration
- **Postman**: Used for manual API request testing and validation

---

## 📦 Deployment

Deployed to **Azure App Service** using Visual Studio’s terminal and Git. Bash/shell commands like `git add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull` were used to manage code during development and deployment cycles.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration & Simulation

Although a personal project, real-world collaboration was simulated by coordinating with mock **QA**, **AMS**, and **Ops** roles to debug and verify API behavior during deployment and integration testing.

---

## 📥 API Integration

- The API is consumed by **Cora Sequence**, a tool that supports Consumer API functionality.
- JavaScript fetches data from the API to dynamically populate **ASP.NET Web Forms** fields in real time.
